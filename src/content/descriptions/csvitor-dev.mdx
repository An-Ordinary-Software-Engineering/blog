I'm a *backend developer* 🗄️, focusing on the **.NET environment**. However, I have been studying other technologies and
languages for a long time, whether in the *backend* or *frontend* 🖥️ (which could be considered a *fullstack* 🔗).
Despite this, my greatest appreciation lies in the entirety of development, that is, before that: **the software processes
and its life cycle** 📊. Therefore, I can say that I am an admirer of *software engineering* ⚙️ and its disciplines!
