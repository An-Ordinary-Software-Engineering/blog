    "I'm a backend developer üóÑÔ∏è, focusing on the .NET environment. However, I have been studying other technologies and languages ‚Äã‚Äãfor a long time, whether in the backend or frontend üñ•Ô∏è (which could be considered a fullstack üîó). Despite this, my greatest appreciation lies in the entirety of development, that is, before that: the software processes and its life cycle üìä. Therefore, I can say that I am an admirer of software engineering ‚öôÔ∏è and its disciplines!",
